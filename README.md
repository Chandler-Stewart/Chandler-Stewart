ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chandler!

I am currently a Power Systems Studies Electrical Engineer working on my own Python scripts for both my Power Systems Tools, such as TARA and PSS/E, and tools that standardize my data for post-processing. I like to think of it as a _micro-ETL_ workflow buildout, but I am also working on trying to create proper ETL projects for my own professional development., 
I dedicate my extra time to my self-study and applying tools, concepts, and applied statistics, aiming to make data engineering the main emphasis of future career opportunities and growth.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any related projects and even some dissimilar projects regarding Python. Ping me on an idea you are thinking about!
