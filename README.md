ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chandler!

I am currently an electrical engineer who has dedicated the last year and a half to self-study and application of predictive modelling tools, concepts, and applied statistics, with the goal of making machine learning the main emphasis of future career opportunities and growth.
- Iâ€™m interested primarily in Computer Vision, but have tried multiple other machine learning applications.
- Iâ€™m working on a water meter read-out project right now, and might move towards some NASA Datasets afterwards.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any related projects, and even some not-so machine learning projects regarding python. Ping me on an idea you are thinking about!
